 ukraine.1.d:0 "While the Red Army was fully mobilized to bring down the insurgency of Vlasov's white forces, Ukraine was considered of little importance and unlikely to be able to revolt as a result of the many pacifications that took place in the region.\n\nIt seems that we have underestimated the impact that the revolt had on the region, as Soviet flags have already begun to be taken down and replaced by the blue and yellow flag and an emergency government, meeting in Kiev, has unilaterally declared the recreation of the Ukrainian People's Republic.\n\nIt now seems obvious that the region can only be taken over by force."
