 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the 1815 Vienna conference on international affairs after Napoleons defeat, The Swiss Confederation is obliged to be neutral in any conflicts between other nations. However, with the rise of the fascists in Germany, Italy and even Austria. Can the Swiss commit to their neutrality? Or will they have to pick a side in a potential future conflict...?"
 
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After failing to capitalize on Ottoman instability following the Great War, Greece suffered further during the Great Depression.  Millions of homeless and poor had nowhere to turn, and with poverty came chaos. Ionnis Metaxas guides Greece at the head of the 4th of August Regime, not purely fascist, democratic, or royalist, but balancing peace in the country. \nThe legacy of Alexander and Justinian calls to the Greek people. With the right leadership, Greece can return to its ancient glories and reclaim its place as a cornerstone of culture and civilization."
 
 HOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Netherlands is in the middle of a deep crisis at the moment. The country has been hit a bit later than others by The Great Depression and consequently, it is currently suffering from its worse consequences. The unemployment is at an all time high and the government have not reacted so far, preferring to stick so far to a policy of budget balance and a faith in the gold standard. Hopefully the economic doctrine of the government is currently shifting due to the pressure of the street. To make matters worse, Germany is rearming and the government know that it will be extremely difficult to stay neutral this time if Europe burns once again."
 
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1932, a coup d'état put an end to the absolute monarchy, the first constitution was put in place and Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) took over. Nevertheless the army was taking an increasing role within the political arena: ousting Prime Minister and replacing him with Phraya Phahonphonphonphayuhasena. As the spectre of fascism embodied by Plaek Phibunsongkhram seems to be gaining support within the military, the division between the wings of the party are widening. Previously brothers, the currents have become rivals and only one will be allowed to preside over the destiny of the country."

 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Belgium may seem like an insignificant territory between France and Germany, but it's a densely industrialized country extracting precious resources from its Congo colony. The country is just recovering from the Great Depression, infrastructure projects are in full swing and the industrial activity is slowly recovering. On the political scene, a greater number of voters seek solutions in extremist discourses. Léon Degrelle gains popularity day by day and may threaten the traditional coalitions of democratic parties. Meanwhile the Flemish nationalists are also active, spreading dissent among the lower ranks of the military..."
  
 BHU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Isolated in the Himalaya, Bhutan stands at the limit of the British sphere of influence. Tied to Britain through the treaty of Punakha, the country has renounced to military forces and relies on the British Indian army for its protection."
 
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "By 1936, Brazil is broken. The Coup of 1930 destroyed our traditions and democratic institutions and soon afterwards, a civil war knocked out the industry and infrastructure of the most important Brazilian state which would make our nation fragile and unstable.\n\nNow with Brazil establishing a solid leadership, the Republic must rebuild itself to secure its future."
 
 COG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Belgian Congo is officially a Belgian colony directly ruled from Brussels. In practice however the general governor Pierre Ryckmans enjoys a certain degree of autonomy due to the distance with Europe. As an exploitation colony, especially one including the "geological scandal" that is Katanga, the Congo has plenty of resources in its ground. Logically, the extraction of those resources will be one of the priorities of the colonial administration. The territory has plenty of tungsten, copper, rubber and of course it has access to the richest mine of uranium ore in the world."
 
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been almost 20 years since Czechoslovakia gained independence from the Austro-Hungarian empire and the small country now counts amongst some of the most industrialized countries in the world\n\nHitler's rise to power in Germany has emboldened the German speaking minority in the border regions and puts the small country under international pressure. France, the traditional ally of Czechoslovakia, is in internal political turmoil and the diplomatic power of the Little Entente is slowly fading, Europe is changing."
 
 HON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Tiburcio Carias Andino barely won the 1932 presidential election, he cracked down on all forms of political opposition while supporting the United Fruit Company's interests. The leader of the BOC, Manuel Calix Herrera, was arrested and imprisioned on the Bay Islands after organizing several worker strikes in that same year. Now, Honduras finds itself at a crossroads. Will Carias continue his presidency, will he be overthrown by the restless campesinos or will the United Fruit Company attempt to seize the country for itself?"
 
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Danish–Icelandic Act of Union, an agreement with Denmark signed on December 1, 1918 and valid for 25 years, recognised Iceland as a fully sovereign and independent state in a personal union with Denmark. The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the Althing."
 
 TIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Tibet may appear as a very stable isolated semi feudal theocracy, but it is quite far from the truth. A few years ago communist and democratic movements were strongly repressed by the ruling religious and civilian aristocracy. The country must reform its army but at the same time the monasteries fear a modernizing army that would challenge their position. Last but not least the country is ruled by a Regent and the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must be found and crowned in order to perpetuate the theocratic system."
