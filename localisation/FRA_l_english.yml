 france.150.d:0 "Following a huge call for a strike by the CGT, whose influence in recent months had reached a point where the government was forced to make increasingly drastic compromises, hundreds of thousands of workers mobilized in Paris towards the Bourbon palace, which for many reminded the riots of February 6, 1934. The latter then forced entry into parliament while in the rest of the city, defections by the army and strong violence could not be contained by the police.\n\nLed by Léon Jouhaux, the latter declared the end of the Third Republic and the transition to an anti-capitalist and trade unionist regime."

 france.151.d:0 "Louis Félix Marie François Franchet d'Espèrey, Marshal and French Head of State, passed away in the night. He was buried and given military honours before being transferred to the Invalides.\n\nThe Marshal's death was sudden for many French people, but also for the government, since no succession procedure had been put in place for the time being. Thus, the various ministers were urgently convened to decide who to appoint as successor.\n\nFor many, the favourite choice is Henri Giraud, Minister of War and who was very close to Franchet d'Esperey throughout his military career.\n\nHowever, another candidate is able to stand up to Giraud. This is François Mitterand, Minister of the Interior, who, although still a simple journalist a few years ago, was able to rise through the ranks of the government at full speed, which allowed him to acquire a great reputation that could well work in his favour."

Many strikes have been organised in support of the front. Léon Blum, the leader of the SFIO, was appointed Prime Minister.\n\nTheir programme is built around the defence of democracy, in particular through their opposition to the far-right leagues, their pacifism, and the implementation of many social reforms such as paid holidays as well as a desire to revive the economy by developing consumption."

In Paris, about 101 hectares, 44 countries offer hundred-four-twenty-ten pavilions around the theme of arts and techniques applied to modern life. Nearly 32 million visitors will rush to come. At the time, Paris will retain the Chaillot Palace, the Palace of discovery, and the Palais de Tokyo. The spirit and the new art triumph everywhere. The world wants to believe for a moment that the exhibition will finally bring together everything that unites men. But strikes the spirits is both monumental Soviet and German pavilions facing to challenge each other: one with a statue of twenty-five metres of Worker and Kolkhoz Woman brandishing a sickle and a hammer; the other by a monumental sculpture of an eagle holding a swastika in its talons."
