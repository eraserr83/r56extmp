 greece.8.t:0 "Turkish offerings"

 greece.9.t:0 "Treaty Of Athens"

 greece.16.t:0 "Operation Restoration"
 greece.16.d:0 " Our government has decided, with support from the military high command, to push further deeper into Anatolia and reclaim lost lands such as Nicomedia and the city of our hearts Constantinople.

 greece.17.t:0 "Greece asks for intervention"

 greece.19.t:0 "Treaty of Rome"

 greece.26.b:0 "Maybe not."
 greece.27.t:0 "Greece asks for Cyprus"
 greece.27.d:0 "It seems that the Greeks have not forgotten about the promise we made them to give Cyprus if they joined the Great War and insist that we should give them Cyprus.

 greece.29.d:0 " The Greek foreign minister has met with our President demanding of a treaty be signed in which multiple regions such as Izmir, Izmit, Instabul and others be ceded to its' 'rightful owner', obviously they can't be taken serious.
