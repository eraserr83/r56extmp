malaysia.1.desc:0 "Despite a relatively peaceful exterior, the settlements, protectorates, and native alliances that make up British Malaya are fraught with tension. Rather than a functioning state, British Malaya comprises a patchwork of various princes and resident generals, who are de-facto lead by the governor of Singapore. The result is a colony that is ready to collapse at any moment, and requires major restructuring if it is to survive the coming storm."

malaysia.2.a:0 "A reasonable request."
